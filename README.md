# Torchsort

![Tests](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Fast, differentiable sorting and ranking in PyTorch.

Pure PyTorch implementation of [Fast Differentiable Sorting and
Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08871) (Blondel et al.). Much of the code is
copied from the original Numpy implementation at
[google-research/fast-soft-sort](https://github.com/google-research/fast-soft-sort),
with the isotonic regression solver rewritten as a PyTorch C++ and CUDA
extension.

## Install

```bash
pip install torchsort
```

To build the CUDA extension you will need the CUDA toolchain installed. If you
want to build in an environment without a CUDA runtime (e.g. docker), you will
need to export the environment variable
`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="Pascal;Volta;Turing;Ampere"` before installing.

<details>
<summary><strong>Conda Installation</strong></summary>
On some systems the package my not compile with `pip` install in conda
environments. If this happens you may need to:
    
 1. Install g++ with `conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64`
 2. Set export variable `export CXX=/path/to/miniconda3/envs/env_name/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-g++`
 3. If still failing, export variable `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/miniconda3/lib`

Thanks to @levnikmyskin for pointing this out!

## Usage

`torchsort` exposes two functions: `soft_rank` and `soft_sort`, each with
parameters `regularization` (`"l2"` or `"kl"`) and `regularization_strength` (a
scalar value). Each will rank/sort the last dimension of a 2-d tensor, with an
accuracy dependant upon the regularization strength:

```python
import torch
import torchsort

x = torch.tensor([[8, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 9]])

torchsort.soft_sort(x, regularization_strength=1.0)
# tensor([[0.5556, 1.5556, 2.5556, 3.5556, 4.5556, 5.5556, 6.5556, 7.5556, 8.5556]])
torchsort.soft_sort(x, regularization_strength=0.1)
# tensor([[-0., 1., 2., 3., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.]])

torchsort.soft_rank(x)
# tensor([[8., 1., 5., 4., 3., 2., 6., 7., 9.]])
```

Both operations are fully differentiable, on CPU or GPU:

```python
x = torch.tensor([[8., 0., 5., 3., 2., 1., 6., 7., 9.]], requires_grad=True).cuda()
y = torchsort.soft_sort(x)

torch.autograd.grad(y[0, 0], x)
# (tensor([[0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111]],
#         device='cuda:0'),)
```

## Example

### Spearman's Rank Coefficient

[Spearman's rank
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
is a very useful metric for measuring how monotonically related two variables
are. We can use Torchsort to create a differentiable Spearman's rank coefficient
function so that we can optimize a model directly for this metric:

```python
import torch
import torchsort

def spearmanr(pred, target, **kw):
    pred = torchsort.soft_rank(pred, **kw)
    target = torchsort.soft_rank(target, **kw)
    pred = pred - pred.mean()
    pred = pred / pred.norm()
    target = target - target.mean()
    target = target / target.norm()
    return (pred * target).sum()

pred = torch.tensor([[1., 2., 3., 4., 5.]], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([[5., 6., 7., 8., 7.]])
spearman = spearmanr(pred, target)
# tensor(0.8321)

torch.autograd.grad(spearman, pred)
# (tensor([[-5.5470e-02,  2.9802e-09,  5.5470e-02,  1.1094e-01, -1.1094e-01]]),)
```

## Benchmark

![Benchmark](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/raw/main/extra/benchmark.png)

`torchsort` and `fast_soft_sort` each operate with a time complexity of *O(n log
n)*, each with some additional overhead when compared to the built-in
`torch.sort`. With a batch size of 1 (see left), the Numba JIT'd forward pass of
`fast_soft_sort` performs about on-par with the `torchsort` CPU kernel, however
its backward pass still relies on some Python code, which greatly penalizes its
performance. 

Furthermore, the `torchsort` kernel supports batches, and yields much better
performance than `fast_soft_sort` as the batch size increases.

![Benchmark](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/raw/main/extra/benchmark_cuda.png)

The `torchsort` CUDA kernel performs quite well with sequence lengths under
~2000, and scales to extremely large batch sizes. In the future the
CUDA kernel can likely be further optimized to achieve performance closer to that of the
built in `torch.sort`.
