# Copied from fast-soft-sort (https://bit.ly/3r0gOav) with the following modifications:
# - replace numpy functions with torch equivalents

# Copied from scikit-learn with the following modifications:
# - use decreasing constraints by default,
# - do not return solution in place, rather save in array `sol`,
# - avoid some needless multiplications.
